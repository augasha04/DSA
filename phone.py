# Think of a way to store the languages as a database (eg an object).
# The languages are listed below so you can copy and paste!
# Write a 'welcome' function that takes a parameter 'language' (always a string), 
# and returns a greeting - if you have it in your database.
# It should default to English if the language is not in the database, 
# or in the event of an invalid input.
