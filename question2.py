# Given an array of integers, 
# filter them according to a simple condition and return an aggregate of the results.
# Task description
# Write a function:

# def solution(A)

# that, given an array A consisting of N integers, 
# returns the maximum among all integers which are multiples of 4.

# For example, given array A as follows:

# [-6, -91, 1011, -100, 84, -22, 0, 1, 473]

# the function should return 84.

# Assume that:

# N is an integer within the range [1..1,000];
# each element of array A is an integer within the range [âˆ’10,000..10,000];
# there is at least one element in array A which satisfies the condition in the task statement.
# In your solution, focus on correctness. 
# The performance of your solution will not be the focus of the assessment.
